## Overview

Real-Time Code Review and Collaboration is a tool designed to enhance team productivity by enabling simultaneous code review, suggestions through real-time collaboration.

Unlike conventional tools where users can write and run code but lack real-time synchronization between different users, our app facilitates seamless connections in real-time coding sessions, bridging the gap for true collaboration. This makes it an ideal choice for teams seeking structured, team-based collaboration without syncing issues.

Note - To run the code you should have required language installed in your pc like if you are running python code you should have python installed in your pc.

## Key Features

- **User Profiles and Team Creation**: Customize your experience and organize your team efficiently.
- **Real-time Coding and Commenting**: Utilize WebRTC for seamless, instantaneous collaboration.
- **AI-powered Assistance**: Benefit from intelligent code suggestions and proactive bug detection.
- **Modern Frontend**: Built with React and Monaco Editor for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **Robust Backend**: Powered by Node.js with WebSocket connections for real-time data transfer.
- **Isolated Environments**: Work in organized, team-specific spaces for enhanced focus and productivity.

## Architecture

The application's architecture is meticulously organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose in the overall system design. For a detailed understanding of the system structure, please refer to the architecture diagram below:

## Why Choose Our App?

If you've used Replit or other similar tools, you've experienced their powerful features. However, one common limitation is the lack of structured team-based collaboration without syncing issues. With our app, users can effortlessly connect to a room, code in real time, and enjoy AI-powered assistance â€” all while working with their team in a more organized, isolated environment.
